This python 3.7 program checks your Momodora RutM program files for the audio folder, then backs up the default music before copying it and shuffling the audio's file names.
This results in the game playing a random audio track when it would normally play one, e.g. on the title screen, in each area, or during boss fights.
You can also use the program to enable or disable the random music, or reshuffle the random music at your leisure. Restart the game for changes to take effect.

Be sure to back up the 'music' folder in your Momodora RutM program files first.
